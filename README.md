# Week-1-Challenge

## Description

This is a website I improved by refactoring the HTML/CSS to make it more semantic, allowing it to be easier to work with and optimizing it for search engine results.

## Usage

This website can be visited using the internet. There are three links at the top which can be clicked on to scroll down to the corresponding paragraphs. 

## Credits

I, Ben Ackerman, refactored this code by myself. The website was originally Â© 2019 Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
